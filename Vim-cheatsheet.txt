Special note on these
---------------------

Vim uses undo branches, not a linear history. This means that you can undo in
different ways to 'normal' programmes. More reading needed but essentially 
switching into and out of INSERT mode will create a new branch along which to 
perform undos. 

Not sure yet how to move between branches yet. 

u               Undo last commands
U               Undo all changes since last insert mode on current line
Ctrl+r          Redo

Substitute
----------

:s/old/new      To substitute new for the first old in a line    
:s/old/new/g    To substitute new for all 'old's on a line       
:#,#s/old/new/g To substitute phrases between two line #'s       
:%s/old/new/g   To substitute all occurrences in the file        
:%s/old/new/gc  To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'            

External Commands
-----------------

:!              Type that and then enter the bash command e.g. 'ls'

Selecting text to write
-----------------------

You can write to a new file by selecting text using `v` and then `:w FILENAME`
to write the selected text out to FILENAME.
